# Solar Calculator - ver 4.0

This script calculates various solar angles like altitude, azimuth, horizontal shadow angle etc. and also gives the value of sunrise time, sunset time, sunrise azimuth angles etc.

The JavaScript code is very old but it still seems to work on modern browsers. It was developed when I was at uni studying architecture for quick solar calculations to aid in designing of shading devices. I still get an email every year or so regarding the code, thus proving that this is still being used (via external sites). I'm sharing the code for those who want to tinker with it.
